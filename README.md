# Tutor Divi Modules

This plugin adds 23+ addons to the Divi page builder and allows you to create your own custom layout and styling for Tutor LMS courses using the powerful Divi page builder.

## Prerequisite

_To make sure everything works perfectly, here are a list of plugins you will need:_

1. [Tutor LMS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor "Tutor LMS")

2. Divi Page Builder

3. Tutor LMS Divi Modules

_Please make sure you have installed and activated the latest version of all these plugins._

## Instructions

Before using the Divi builder for your courses, you must give edit privileges to it which will allow you to create custom single pages for Divi. To do so, you must first head to the Dashboard > Divi Page builder > Theme Options > Builder and make sure Courses are toggled on. 

If you want to edit each course’s layout separately, navigate from your WP Admin panel to Tutor LMS > Courses and then open any course in editing mode.

Then, click on “Edit With Divi Page builder” to start the Divi Page builder interface from the default editing panel. You will find all the necessary modules to create a single course page from the left sidebar’s Tutor LMS section.
